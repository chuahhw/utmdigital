<h2>Reflections </h2>
<p>The information i gained through industrial visit to UTMDigital is I get to know more about the services provided by
UTMDigital and i know that i should use the services provided wisely in the future. The improvement that I want to suggest is I hope that the time of the visit to UTMDigital will be longer. In my opinion, I think that visiting UTMDigital help me to learn the course material better because we have a
chance to take a closer look about the real ICT working environment.</p>
